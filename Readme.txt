In case you're looking through the files and are wondering why files have no version history:
I renamed the project from UnrealSFAS to Mazeum. This meant moving all files, but this also hides the history of those files.
For this reason, I added the tag "Release-1" to the last commit before doing this (https://bitbucket.org/timrademaker/sfas_2021_unreal/src/Release-1/)
Nothing has been changed to source files after they were renamed, so these files can be checked if you want to see file history.
