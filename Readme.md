This repository contains the source code of my entry for the 2021's Search For A Star Programming challenge (Rising Star category), [where I made it to the finals](https://gradsingames.com/search-for-a-star/sfas-2021-the-finalists/).

The competition entry can be found [here on itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/sfas-games-programming-2021/rate/871002). Further documentation on the project can also be downloaded from this page.

## The game
In Mazeum, you play as a thief trying to steal a high-value item from a museum. You canâ€™t just walk in and take the item, but  will have to sneak through the vents to get where you want to go. Not all vents are connected to each other, and not all rooms are easily accessible, so you'll have to go in and out of the vents to find your way through the museum.

## Why do the source files have no version history?
I renamed the project from UnrealSFAS to Mazeum. This meant moving all files, but this also hides the history of those files.

For this reason, I added the tag "Pre-Rename" to the last commit before doing this (https://github.com/timrademaker/Mazeum/tree/Pre-Rename)

Not much has been changed in the source files after they were renamed, so these files can be checked if you want to see file history.
